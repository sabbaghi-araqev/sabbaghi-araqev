Hi, I’m @sabbaghi-araqev.

I’m the CTO and President of @Araqev.

- Araqev is a software company that uses its patented ML algorithms to solve the $2 billion problem in quality for additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.

- We enable users to learn in seconds how to print more accurately across new shapes and processes, reducing scrap and machining time.

- Our software takes scanned data from previous, scrapped parts to rapidly learn from them how to correct new shapes under new processes. We use rich information that has been ignored in the past to improve the manufacturing process.

- The beta version of our software can reduce the number of reprints for a shape by 70%. 

Ultimately, Araqev creates smart software for superior additive manufacturing.
